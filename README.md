# ML/AI Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning and AI Projects repository! This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that outline various machine learning and AI projects I have worked on and am currently building. It serves as a playpen for my experiments, learnings, and explorations in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Purpose

- This repository is an evolving space where I share my experiences with machine learning and AI. 
- Each notebook represents a different project or experiment, showcasing different techniques, algorithms, and insights I've gained along the way.
- The goal is to create a natural and engaging overview of my work, making it accessible and informative for anyone interested in these topics.

## Projects

- [Linear Regression on Housing Data](ML_LinearRegression/README.md): Implementation of Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression models to predict housing prices based on various features.
- [Stock Sentiment Analysis](Stock_Sentiment_Analysis/README.md): This notebook demonstrates how to use a large language model (LLM) for sentiment analysis on publicly traded stock data.
- [Vertex ML Training](Vertex_ML_Training): This notebook demonstrates how to train a machine learning model at scale using Google Cloud's Vertex AI Training Service, including data preparation, model training, and deployment.
- [RAG System](RAG_SYSTEM): This notebook demonstrates a RAG system using Google Cloud's AI Platform, UMAP, and Python libraries to process and analyze text data from the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu book.
-  [Resume Builder](Resume_Builder): This notebook demonstrates how to optimize resumes based on specific job descriptions using AI, including data import, prompt creation, API interaction, and output formatting for printing.
- [MindBody Workouts Analysis](Workouts/MindBody_Workouts.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates how to extract and analyze workout class activity data from MindBody.com using BeautifulSoup, pandas, and matplotlib for reporting and analysis.
- [Work In Progress](WIP): Projects that are currently in progress and not yet completed.

## How to Use

Each project folder contains a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the notebooks. Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository. Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, code, and results. You can run the notebooks locally or view them directly on GitHub.
