# Machine Learning and AI Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning and AI Projects repository! This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that outline various machine learning and AI projects I have worked on and am currently building. It serves as a playpen for my experiments, learnings, and explorations in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Purpose

This repository is a dynamic and evolving space where I document my journey through the fascinating world of machine learning and AI. Each notebook represents a unique project or experiment, showcasing different techniques, algorithms, and insights I have gained along the way. The goal is to create a natural and engaging overview of my work, making it accessible and informative for anyone interested in these topics.

## Projects

- [Linear Regression on Housing Data](ML_LinearRegression/README.md): Implementation of Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression models to predict housing prices based on various features.

## How to Use

Each project folder contains a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the notebooks. Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository. Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, code, and results. You can run the notebooks locally or view them directly on GitHub.
