## Machine Learning Project: Linear Regression & Decision Tree Regression on US Housing Data

This project involves implementing Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression models using US Housing Data. The goal is to analyze and predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data using Seaborn plots to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Linear Regression model.
   - Train a Decision Tree Regression model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. **Visualization**: Visualize the predictions and residuals to understand the model performance.

## Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Files:
- `LR_HousingData.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/USA_housing.csv`: Dataset used for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
